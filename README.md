# Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Project

Welcome to the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) project! In this project, we have developed a DAO that operates entirely on the blockchain, where decisions and actions are taken without human intervention. The DAO's primary function is similar to that of Compound, allowing stakeholders to vote on and modify a specific value within a smart contract.

## Project Overview

In this project, we have created a simple smart contract that holds a specific value. Stakeholders in the DAO can propose and vote on changes to this value using a democratic voting mechanism. The smart contract autonomously executes the changes based on the consensus reached by the stakeholders.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dao-project.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Deploy the smart contract to your chosen blockchain network (e.g., local development environment, testnet, or mainnet).

4. Interact with the smart contract by participating in the DAO governance process, voting on proposals, and changing the value within the contract.

## Usage

Here's how to use the project:

1. Stakeholders interact with the DAO by submitting proposals and voting on proposed changes.

2. Proposals are accepted or rejected based on the consensus of the stakeholders.

3. If a proposal is accepted, the smart contract autonomously executes the proposed change to the contract's value.

4. Users can monitor the contract's state and voting results through a front-end interface or directly on the blockchain.

## Testing

We have included a set of tests to ensure the reliability of the DAO and its components. You can run the tests using the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This will execute the test suite and provide insights into the functionality and correctness of the DAO.

## Scripts

In the `scripts` directory, you will find useful scripts that demonstrate how to interact with the DAO programmatically. These scripts can be customized to suit your specific use case.
